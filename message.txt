Please I don't want to scream
(Devil eyes come, eyes open, eyes open)
Please I don't want to scream
(Scream scream scream scream)
Spreading in the darkness, scream

The night grows deeper
Wrapped around in stormy clouds
Thunder, please come
Drop thunder hard
I'll lock up that BOCA

Where is the love
If those thorny words
Start to hurt you
I won't let them open that BOCA

See the hidden secret, odd eye
Fall even deeper inside
Covered by the sweetness
Of all of the lies

The eyes have worn down the border
Despair coming at you till the end
Will there ever be an end?
Back and forth, this isn't the place you've been looking for
No more Utopia
